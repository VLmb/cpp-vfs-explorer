The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest member of the cat family, recognizable by its orange coat with black stripes and white underparts.
A solitary and territorial predator, it primarily hunts large ungulates using stealth, strength, and powerful jaws. Tigers inhabit diverse Asian habitats—from tropical forests and grasslands to mangrove swamps—and require large territories to survive.
Poaching and habitat loss have driven several tiger subspecies toward endangerment; conservation efforts focus on protecting habitat, curbing illegal trade, and monitoring wild populations.
